# Holiday Cost

## Description
This python code will calculate a user’s total holiday cost, which includes the plane cost, hotel cost, and car-rental cost.
● First, the code will ask the user to enter the following inputs:
○ city_flight: The city they will be flying to. I have created some options for them. Each city will have different flight costs.
○ num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel.
○ rental_days: The number of days for which they will be hiring a
car.
● I have created the following functions to handle different cases:
● hotel_cost(): This function will take 'num_nights' as an argument,
and return a total cost for the hotel stay. The cost per night can be customised. 

● plane_cost(): This function will take city_flight as an argument
and return a cost for the flight. 
● car_rental(): This function will take rental_days as an argument
and return the total cost of the car rental cost.
● holiday_cost(): This function takes three arguments: num_nights,
city_flight, and rental_days. Using these three arguments, call the
hotel_cost(), plane_cost(), and car_rental() functions with
their respective arguments, and finally return the total cost for the
holiday.
● The outcomes will be printed to show the cost of the holiday in a readable way.
